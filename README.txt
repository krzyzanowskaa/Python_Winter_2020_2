The program is a function that will show best and worst hours for asking questions on HackerNews based on average number of comments for specific hours of the day. The calculations are based on the .csv file downloaded from the HackerNews statistics page. To run the program, user needs to run function: 

top_and_worst_hours_for_posting('file_name')

where file_name is the name of the .csv file, in this case: 'HackerNews'.

The program should show best and worst 5 hours to post questions in the forum with average number of comments next to the hour.


No additional Python packages necessary to run the code - the requirements.txt generated with pip command is empty.
